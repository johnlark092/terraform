# Terraform Learning Session Demo
This repository serves as a demo for Deloitte's Diversity and Inclusion Terraform learning sessions. In this demo, users will learn the foundations of Terraform and provision an application end to end. Users will build upon each session and provision core GCP resources required for a secure and functioning web application. The final result will be an application deployed on a Google Compute VM, networking infrastructure including VPCs, subnets, and firewall rules, and a service account with least privileged roles assigned. Additionally, this use case will highlight core Terraform features including resources, data blocks, modules, variables, outputs, and dependency linking.
